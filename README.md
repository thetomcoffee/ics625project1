# ICS 625 Project 1
 Project 1 of ICS 625 course at Metro State. Uses XML, XML Schema, XPath, and XSLT to transform an XML docudement into HTML. 
   
## Directions:  
  
This project will let you practice your skills in XML, XML Schema, XPath, and XSLT. You should create a
new HTML5 project and name it ICS625 Project 1. You may use any references to help you with this
project.
  
For this project, you will do the followings:
* Create an XML schema for course sections offered each semester.
* Create an XML document based on the schema and populate it with at least three sections. You
can use the sections and course information from the picture below.
* Create an XSLT document to transform XML section listing to an HTML web page containing a
table of offered sections (see picture).
  
The XML Schema should have the following structure.
  
- Sections
  - Section
    - Section Number
    - Course
      - Id e.g. 000204
      - Number e.g. ICS 141
      - Title e.g. Computational Thinking
    - Instructor
      - First
      - Last
    - Date Range
      - Start date
      - End date
    - Capacity
    - Enrolled
    - Days (M,T,W,R,F)
    - Location
      - Building (ONLINE for online class)
      - Room (METRO for online class)
      - Credits
      - Status (Open, Full, Canceled)
  
The HTML result generated by your XSLT file should look like the picture below.
